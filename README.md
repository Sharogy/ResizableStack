# ResizableStack

This is an eclipse JavaFX app.

Initiallize it was part of an assignment to code a resizable stack, 
later on it was expanded to include an analysis interface that calculates operation time complexity of the stack under different operations.
Further it was expanded to include a Binary Search inside the stack.
